\title{List and Mask Environment Variables}
\usage{
renviron_list(.renviron = NULL, scope = c("project", "user"))
}
\arguments{
\item{.renviron}{An optional named list of environment variables to list. If not provided,
the function will load the variables from the .Renviron file using \code{renviron_load()}
with the specified scope and mask their values.}

\item{scope}{A character vector specifying the scope(s) to search for the .Renviron file when
loading environment variables. This is used only when \code{.renviron} is \code{NULL}. Valid values
are "user" and "project". The function searches in the order provided. The default order
is \code{c("project", "user")}.}
}
\value{
A named list of all environment variables with their values masked. For example,
all values might be replaced with "****" to hide sensitive information. If called without
the .renviron argument, it returns the list of variables from the .Renviron file within the
specified scope with masked values.
}
\description{
This function lists all environment variables currently set in the .Renviron file, considering
both user and project scopes as defined by the \code{scope} argument, or in a provided named list of
environment variables, masking their values for security purposes. This provides a quick overview
of the variables, which can be useful for debugging or auditing without exposing sensitive information.

# List and mask variables from a provided named list
