\title{Save Environment Variables to the .Renviron File}
\usage{
renviron_save(env, confirm = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{env}{A named list where each name is an environment variable key and each value is
the corresponding value for that key. The function expects the list values to be character strings.}

\item{confirm}{Logical; if TRUE, the function will ask for user confirmation before overwriting
the .Renviron file. Default is FALSE for backward compatibility and non-interactive use cases.}
}
\value{
None. This function performs a file write operation and does not return any value.
}
\description{
This function takes a named list of environment variables and saves them to the .Renviron file,
as determined by \code{renviron_path()}. If \code{confirm} is TRUE, the function will ask for user confirmation
before overwriting the file. This is useful for programmatically updating or setting environment
variables that need to persist across R sessions.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assuming you want to set or update environment variables
new_env <- list(CENSUS_API_KEY = "12345", GITHUB_PAT = "abcde")

# Save these variables to the .Renviron file, asking for confirmation
renviron_save(new_env, confirm = TRUE)
}
