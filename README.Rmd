`renviron` is an R package designed to streamline the management of environment variables within R projects. It facilitates the creation, modification, and deletion of variables in the `.Renviron` file, enabling dynamic environment variable handling directly from R. This toolkit is essential for projects that require precise control over environment configurations, such as managing API keys, database credentials, and application-specific settings.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `renviron` from [Adatar's r-universe](https://adatar-do.r-universe.dev/renviron) with:

```r
install.packages("renviron", repos = "https://adatar-do.r-universe.dev")
```

## Usage

### Loading environment variables

Load all environment variables from the `.Renviron` file into a named list.

```r
library(renviron)
env_vars <- renviron_load()
```

### Adding a new variable

Add a new environment variable or update an existing one.

```r
renviron_add("NEW_VAR", "new_value")
```

### Getting a variable's value

Retrieve the value of a specific environment variable.

```r
api_key <- renviron_get("API_KEY")
```

### Deleting a variable

Remove an environment variable.

```r
renviron_delete("OBSOLETE_VAR")
```

### Listing all variables

Get a list of all environment variables currently set.

```r
all_vars <- renviron_list()
```
