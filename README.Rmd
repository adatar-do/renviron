`renviron` is an R package designed to streamline the management of environment variables within R projects. It facilitates the creation, modification, and deletion of variables in the `.Renviron` file, enabling dynamic environment variable handling directly from R. This toolkit is essential for projects that require precise control over environment configurations, such as managing API keys, database credentials, and application-specific settings.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `renviron` from [Adatar's r-universe](https://adatar-do.r-universe.dev/renviron) with:

```r
install.packages("renviron", repos = "https://adatar-do.r-universe.dev")
```

## Usage

### Understanding Scope

When working in RStudio, the project-level `.Renviron` file is automatically loaded upon opening a project, making environment variables defined at the project scope readily available. However, `renviron` extends this functionality by allowing management of environment variables across both project and user scopes:

- **Project Scope**: Variables specific to the current R project.
- **User Scope**: Global variables that apply across all projects for the user.

This distinction is crucial for managing environment variables that are either specific to a project or meant to be globally accessible across multiple projects.

### The Scope Argument

The `scope` argument is a powerful feature in the `renviron` package that provides flexibility in managing environment variables across different levels of your R environment. Available in all main functions of the package, `scope` allows you to specify whether you want to interact with environment variables at the project level, the user level, or both. This feature is especially useful when working within RStudio, which automatically loads project-level `.Renviron` files.

- **Project Scope**: When `scope` is set to `"project"`, `renviron` functions will operate on the `.Renviron` file located in your current R project directory. This is useful for setting environment variables that are specific to the project you are working on.

- **User Scope**: Setting `scope` to `"user"` directs `renviron` functions to work with the `.Renviron` file in your user home directory. Variables set at this level are accessible across all your R projects, making this scope suitable for global configurations and secrets.

- **Both Scopes**: You can also specify both scopes by using `scope = c("project", "user")`. In this case, `renviron` functions will prioritize the project scope over the user scope when reading, adding, or updating environment variables. This ensures that project-specific settings take precedence, while still allowing access to user-level configurations.

### Usage Across Functions

All main functions in the `renviron` package, including `renviron_load`, `renviron_list`, `renviron_add`, `renviron_get`, and `renviron_delete`, support the `scope` argument. This consistency allows you to seamlessly manage your environment variables with precision, whether you're loading variables, adding new ones, retrieving specific variables, or deleting them.

For example, RStudio will automatically load the project-level `.Renviron` file when you open a project. To load environment variables from user scope, you can use:

```r
renviron_load("user")
```

Now you can access the user-level variables in your R environment.

To add a new variable to the user-level `.Renviron` file, bypassing the project-level file, you can specify:

```r
renviron_add("GLOBAL_API_KEY", "12345abcde", scope = "user")
```

This uniform approach to `scope` across the `renviron` package enhances your control over where and how environment variables are managed within your R environment, catering to a wide range of use cases from project-specific configurations to global settings.


### Loading environment variables

Load all environment variables from the `.Renviron` file.

```{r}
library(renviron)
renviron_load()
```

Now you can access the variables from the system environment

```{r}
Sys.getenv("SECRET_1")
```

Alternatively, you can capture the variables directly into a named list

```{r}
env <- renviron_load()
env$SECRET_1
```

### Listing all variables

Get a list of all environment variables currently set. This will return a named list with all the variables and their values. For security reasons, the values are masked. So, you can use this function to list all the variables without revealing their values.

```{r}
renviron_list()
```

### Adding a new variable

Add a new environment variable or update an existing one.

```{r}
renviron_add("NEW_VAR", "new_value")
Sys.getenv("NEW_VAR")
```

This will add or update the variable `NEW_VAR` with the value `new_value` in the system environment, if you want to save it to the `.Renviron` file, you can use the `in_place` argument.

```{r}
renviron_add("NEW_VAR", "new_value", in_place = TRUE, confirm = FALSE)
renviron_list()
```

Note: The `confirm` argument is set to `TRUE` by default, which will prompt you to confirm the changes before saving them to the `.Renviron` file. If you want to save the changes without confirmation, you can set `confirm = FALSE`.

Alternatively, you can capture the variables directly into a named list no matter if you save it to the `.Renviron` file or not.

```{r}
env <- renviron_add("NEW_VAR", "new_value")
env$NEW_VAR
```

### Getting a variable's value

Retrieve the value of a specific environment variable.

```{r}
renviron_get("SECRET_1")
```

### Deleting a variable

Remove an environment variable.

```{r}
renviron_delete("SECRET_1")
Sys.getenv("SECRET_1")
```
